The project UniApp is designed to be an app that will scoure the local area and look for the best deals on groceries and other food stuff.
the idea behind it was to create an app that means you spend a little more time going to 2 or 3 shops yet you are able to save money by doing so.
with most of the processing being done online, there is little space that is needed to be used on the phone.
